###### The Verandah
The verandah faces east-south-east. The morning air was fresh after the night's heavy rainfall. And the rising sun was sharp, casting a barcode-like pattern on the tiled verandah floors. I tried to stay on the cooler, dark stripes; Zarah was everywhere–pushing the light plastic chair and banging her seemingly unbreakable toy on the ground. She had gotten up some time  between 6AM and 6:30AM and was ready to go. Her Mom tried to put her back to sleep. She resisted, cried and I got her. It was still cool, so I decided to take for a walk–a push in her stroller, allowing Mom to get some sleep. The sights and early morning sounds were new; she was quiet, turning her head from side to side and looking back at me and smiling once in a while. The street could be described as rugged, euphemistically; this portion had no major potholes but was sandy with exposed rocks.
